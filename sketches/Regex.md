1. A CHARACTER SAYS “AN ALPHABET IS MADE OF A SET OF SYMBOLS, WHERE A SEQUENCE OF SYMBOLS COMPOSE A WORD.”
2. THE CHARACTER SAYS “IF WE TAKE THE ALPHABET $\alpha=\{0,1\}$ and randomly generate words with $\alpha$ via a regular expression, eventually it would write a valid computer program that could solve one of our many great problems like world hunger and politics!
3. THE CHARACTER SAYS “Shame i don’t have the time nor the resources to try all those combinations!”
4. THE SCENE ALERTS “somewhere, someone with time and resources“ AND THEN A DRAWING OF A COMPUTER BECOMING A DEMON AND A SCARY PROGRAMMER.
